679455653,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,"I'm not a huge mcds lover, but I've been to better ones. This is by far the worst one I've ever been too! It's filthy inside and if you get drive through they completely screw up your order every time! The staff is terribly unfriendly and nobody seems to care."
679455654,2/21/2015 0:27,Atlanta,,,"Terrible customer service. Î¾I came in at 9:30pm and stood in front of the register and no one bothered to say anything or help me for 5 minutes. Î¾There was no one else waiting for their food inside either, just outside at the window. Î¾ I left and went to Chickfila next door and was greeted before I was all the way inside. This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers."
679455655,2/21/2015 0:26,Atlanta,,,"First they ""lost"" my order, actually they gave it to someone one else than took 20 minutes to figure out why I was still waiting for my order.They after I was asked what I needed I replied, ""my order"".They asked for my ticket and the asst mgr looked at the ticket then incompletely filled it.I had to ask her to check to see if she filled it correctly.She acted as if she couldn't be bothered with that so I asked her again.She begrudgingly checked to she did in fact miss something on the ticket.So after 22 minutes I finally had my breakfast biscuit platter.As I left an woman approached and identified herself as the manager, she was dressed as if she had just awoken in an old t-shirt and sweat pants.She said she had heard what happened and said she'd take care of it.Well why didn't she intervene when she saw I was growing annoyed with the incompetence?"
679455656,2/21/2015 0:27,Atlanta,,,I see I'm not the only one giving 1 star. Only because there is not a -25 Star!!! That's all I need to say!
679455657,2/21/2015 0:27,Atlanta,,,"Well, it's McDonald's, so you know what the food is. Î¾This review reflects solely on the poor service. Î¾I have been to this location countless times over the years. Î¾They consistently fail on the service end of things. Î¾The order takers tend to be rude, no smiles, and a lot of ""sighs"" and ""lip smacking"" when you talk to them. Î¾So why go back you ask? This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. Î¾The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Î¾Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. Î¾I have given them many chances at earning a positive review. Î¾I could not recommend this location any less. Î¾If you can wait, take a pass. Î¾There are better McDonald's stores in Griffin, GA."
679455658,2/21/2015 0:13,Atlanta,,,This has to be one of the worst and slowest McDonald's franchises there is. Can't figure out why my Egg McMuffin is always on a stale un-toasted English muffin. Bought A chocolate shake today and threw it away.
679455659,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,"I'm not crazy about this McDonald's. Î¾This is primarily because they are so slow. Î¾My gosh what exactly is the hold up? Î¾It's FAST food people. Î¾Also, this morning, I guess the worker thought his mic was off, but it wasn't. Î¾I now know that he is trying to get as many hours as possible because he needs money BAD. Î¾Spread the word. Î¾Anyway, this location is on a little access road Î¾and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. Î¾It would have helped if there was one. Î¾So, in the end I think I'll avoid this location and find another. Î¾This should be easy as there is no shortage of Mickey D's in this piece."
679455660,2/21/2015 0:15,Atlanta,,,"One Star and I'm beng kind. I blame management. last day of free coffee so ""we"" decide to stop and order breakfast and coffees thru drive-thru. She charged us for coffee and when asked why she said she needed to confirm there were two of us in the car. Now she has to clear the order and that took retraining. Ask next time at tthe speaker.Oh it gets better....We get to next window where Einstein is waiting, pours the coffees with different creams/sugars added. ""Which one is which?"" I asked... and he smiled and said ""One has 2 cream 2 sugar and the other has 3 cream 1 sugar"".. didnt maek the cups... but at least he made sure we had straws for our coffees.... Hello? management? Where are You?"
679455661,2/21/2015 0:29,Atlanta,,,"Never been upset about any fast food drive thru service till I came to this McDonalds.After a long trip from California my wife and I went to McDonalds for a quick bite to eat before our drive back home. We pull up to the drive thru but there are a lot of cars waiting to order. We were guessing there must be a lot demand for McDonalds at this late hour. So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order. However, we wait for almost another 10 min to finally pay at the first window - then another 5 more min to finally receive our food. By far the worst McDonalds in the world. Unfriendly and slow."
679455662,2/21/2015 0:12,Atlanta,,,"This McDonald's has gotten much better. Usually my order would be wrong every single time so I would not leave that window until I checked every single item. I only hit up fast food once a month or so and it needs to be worth it. Also the fries used to be cold and the cheese on the burger was never melted. Everything was just lukewarm. Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN. Sometimes its nice to sneak away for a quick weekend breakfast, you know, a little budget and time friendly mommy and me date."
679455663,2/21/2015 0:38,Atlanta,,,Let's start here only reason I came into McDonald's waste time till girlfriend flight arrives and Î¾for my duaghters. I don't eat fast food ordered two happy meals slow service... While ordering my food Î¾a guy ask the cashier two use his cell in the middle of my order that was strike one then give me little boy toys knowing I have twin girls stabding right in front of him. Im glad I will never have to return here I live way in sandy springs.... I can see the difference between service and the staff The building it self is brand new change your staff this is Blackmac not McDonald's im black myself but telling the truth
679455664,2/21/2015 0:40,Atlanta,,,"Other businesses throughout Metro Atlanta opened their doors to stranded motorists during the Jan. 2014 snow storm. This McDonald's on Camp Creek Parkway told Î¾a group of senior citizens who were on the way home from an outing that they had to leave their restaurant. Î¾All they cared about was the dollar. Î¾After they got that, they were done with them. Î¾Too bad they couldn't have made it down the street to Wendy's or Chic Fil A and other restaurants."
679455665,2/21/2015 0:24,Atlanta,,,"The drive thru makes them lost a star since my last review.This is one of those two lane drive thrus, and I know that the function of that is so that the orders are not messed up when you get to the window, but almost everytime, the cashier ends up asking me what did I order. Î¾I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer. One of my biggest pet peeves is that the drive thru staff has no smile in their voice. When you are ordering food from the luxury of your vehicle you want to think that the person in charge of taking your order is in good spirits, but not at this location."
679455666,2/21/2015 0:15,Atlanta,,,"Believe it or not, this used to be q really good McDonalds. The drive throuh is so slow, it is frustrating but the service is always friendly. Food is normally luke warm. My niece likes the toys from McDonalds, I wonder if I pull up to the window and say, let me just get the toy, woulf service be faster?"
679455667,2/21/2015 0:37,Atlanta,,,"As the previous yelpers have already stated, this place is pretty slow. The food is usually cold.. and the service....yeah. you guessed it. Poor."
679455668,2/21/2015 0:38,Atlanta,,,25 minutes in drive through line. Gunshots from the apartments behind. Î¾Worst McDonald's ever!
679455669,2/21/2015 2:30,Atlanta,,,"Super slow service, food's terrible like its been sitting and then reheated. Î¾Everything is out, napkins, iced tea"
679455670,2/21/2015 0:15,Atlanta,,,"SLOW-SLOW-SLOW! Î¾Don't go here if you have a flight to catch...or a life to live!!!!! Î¾If you're hungry, wait until you get to the airport. Î¾This particular McDonald's is just not worth your time."
679455671,2/21/2015 0:44,Atlanta,,,"On your way to the airport or just cruising down Camp Creek Pkwy? Î¾Are you absolutely in Love with McDonald's Sweet Tea? Well then don't ever go through this drive thru. Î¾Hands down this is the slowest McDonald's drive thru I've experienced in Atlanta. Î¾Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. Î¾As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. Î¾She told a few of her associates that it was like ""syrup"" and ""liquid diabetes"". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup! Î¾Thank goodness for the McDonald's near Perimeter Mall because they refilled my drink. So the moral to the story is, if you're on Camp Creek Pkwy near the airport, bypass McDonald's and head for Chick-fil-A. #EatMoreChicken"
679455672,2/21/2015 0:45,Atlanta,,,This is the worst McDonalds I have ever seen. Î¾The service was terrible and the employees were either lazy or incompetent. I will never return to this establishment.
679455673,2/21/2015 1:07,Atlanta,,,"I had the McCafe Mocha and must say that it was better than drinking sand and salt water, that's about it.Too sweet and I couldn't even taste the coffee over the other weird flavors going on in this drink.Stick with the Starbucks mocha, folks. Î¾Trust me on this one."
679455674,2/21/2015 0:43,Atlanta,,,"GHETTO!! went in yesterday just to get a soda and could not even park in handicap parking spot because their delivery truck was blocking all spaces. Î¾Finally made it inside and it was about 5 customers to one cashier. The shift manager made the comment that the car that was waiting needed to be pulled up because they are holding up her line. Î¾Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don't like to feel like I am in someone's ""hood"" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don't care or maybe even steal themselves. Î¾plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes"
679455675,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,"I visited mcdonalds on Dec 20, 2011 at 12:54 I bought 3 cheese burgers 2 large fries and 2 orders of pies. Î¾They charged me for 3 fries so I went back into store and told the cashier. She denied I said Î¾ I ordered 2 fries. Î¾Then manager came over and said whats the problem. I told him and he said looked into the bag, grabbed the xtra fries and lterally threw them into the waste bucket by the drive tru from the cashier . Î¾Then reached into cash register and gave me change for the fries. Î¾Then i said thank you and he said ok boss and I left. Î¾I then called mcdonalds people via the nimber on the website after I ate. I told then I was going to wait to yelp after I heard from McDonalds. Î¾Still no call or email. Î¾As a side note ...Tom N. Î¾(the otther yelper) is right, they are very rude there and seem bothered to help you and not at all nice to the kids. Î¾The play room is sticky and the video games in ther always cause an altercation with kids and parents. Î¾The only reason I gave 2 stars was because the fries were hot and the sweet potatoe fries were good and warm."
679455676,2/21/2015 0:28,Atlanta,,,I usually hit the drive thru once or twice a week for breakfast. A lot of times the forget to include the hash brown if I order a meal. If I order hot cakes they usually forget either butter or utinsils prompting me to have to go inside. The food is also very inconsistent.
679455677,2/21/2015 0:16,Atlanta,,,"What a joke.Don't do take out as you will not get anything that you ordered. We prefers and paid for items only to get home with 50% of the order accurate. I've been there numerous times and sadly the same thing happens. It's my fault because I should learn.Does anyone know the owner?I can't believe that he would like this comment. Woodstock Macdonalds is not the place that Ray Crock invented. Save yourself the frustration and waste if money, don't go there!I've learned now."
679455678,2/21/2015 0:13,Atlanta,,,I wish I can give zero stars. Freezing cold reheated soggy fries and twice fried chewy nuggets = straight to my trash can.
679455679,2/21/2015 0:54,Atlanta,,,"I agree with most reviewers on this one. Staff is always rude and annoyed that you're there!!1 I travel weekly to Atlanta Hartsfield Airport and this McDonald's never has fresh hot coffee at 4:30/5:00 AM. Always have to wait while they brew coffee, WTH!!"
679455680,2/21/2015 0:15,Atlanta,,,"I don't think this location deserves even one star. Î¾This is the filthiest McDonalds I have ever visited. Î¾I have been to hundreds of different McDonalds in numerous states as well as 19 foreign countries. I went to this location on 3/29/12 for breakfast. Î¾The first thing I noticed was that the floor was sticky. (A previous reviewer made a similar comment about the play area.) When I noticed this, I said to myself, ""this isn't right."" Î¾Then when I looked for a place to sit, I spotted all the debris in the seat crevices and the floor. There were also flies in the dining area which I had to repeatedly brush off my food. Î¾As for the food, it seemed OK, except, this was the first time ever that I was given cold syrup for my hotcakes at a McDonalds.."
679455681,2/21/2015 0:13,Atlanta,,,This is one rude Mcdonalds! The food takes longer to prepare than any other Macdonalds I have ever been to. The people working there always seem annoyed like you are bothering them just by being there. I avoid this mc d's whenever I can.
679455682,2/21/2015 0:37,Atlanta,,,the managers at this mcdonalds are awesome but some of the workers are lazy. Î¾overall an average mcdonalds. Î¾after visiting it and some other once i realized that this one is really average. Î¾the only thing good about this one is that the management is awesome and its across the street from my house so i can sit around and study till midnight and no one bothers me.
679455683,2/21/2015 0:15,Atlanta,,,"It had been a while since I had stopped at this particular one. Î¾They have done a total remodel and it looks fairly fresh. Î¾Stopped by about Î¾10-11pm and went through drive thru. Î¾I thought I'd try a new McWrap. Î¾Got a fry and a spicy chick along with that. Î¾ I was asked to pull up after sitting at the window for a few minutes and they would bring me Î¾my order. Î¾That is fine, except about 15 minutes later I'm still waiting. Î¾So I go to check what is going on and end up waiting another 5 minutes. Î¾ It appeared I wasn't the only one that had a long wait in drive thru as well. Î¾ McWrap - I was disappointed. Î¾Looked like a wrap that had grilled chicken sprinkle with some mixed greens, then had sweet and sour sauce dumped in it."
679455684,2/21/2015 0:29,Atlanta,,,Disorganized. Î¾Didn't even get to order. Employees were hanging out with friends out front.
679455685,2/21/2015 0:09,Atlanta,,,"This has got to be one of the busiest McDonald's in the metro area ... if not the southeast ... and they are fairly efficient despite being so busy all the time.You can come by just about any time of the day and find the line of cars for the ""drive-thru"" wrapped around the building...It's generally more efficient to go into the building and place your order than wait in the line of cars spewing smog... and since the building is open 24 hours now that should make it easy to get your McFix...good job, Clairmont McDonald's!"
679455686,2/21/2015 0:54,Atlanta,,,"THIS MCDONALDS IS HORRIBLE! They are also down the street from my house. You might just want to go to the next McDonald's down the street, less than half a mile maybe. It's brand new and just opened. The reviews here speak for themselves. NO CUSTOMER SERVICE WHATSOEVER. they always rush you at drive-thru and never get the meal correct because they are all ignorant fucks who can't speak proper English or don't even know English. They don't even give you time to respond on an order completion. I've dined inside and it was fine, however it was dirty around me on most occasions. But 99% of the time I eat there, MY MEAL IS ALWAYS INCORRECT! Always! It's ridiculous! I found out it's an ongoing problem; especially at this store. The fries are always pre sorted and they are a hot or miss. They are really good or really bad, which is really annoying. The sandwich is the same, sometimes they put fresh dripping meat on the bun and it makes it soggy, which is disgusting. Most of the times the sandwich is just plain incorrect. I've had to call corporate about the poor customer service I've had with employees and several managers at this location; as well as the constant issue of my order being messed up (which is very inconvenient in drive-thru). I'm telling you, go to the next McDonald's. The employees here hate their job and are idiots."
679455687,2/21/2015 0:24,Atlanta,,,"Nuts and bolts: Stopped by on my way into work to grab breakfast after getting some Sam's Club gas.Pros: Convenient location for me, right off I-85. Fast service.Cons: The sausage biscuit I had was sub-par. Î¾The biscuit was overcooked and hard. Î¾The sausage was not cooked enough. Î¾Only gave me one jelly packet. Î¾Most places give me at least two. Î¾Forgot to give me a straw for my sweet tea. Î¾Sweet tea was not sweet enough. Î¾Gave me no napkins. Î¾Neutral: Î¾When I was in line paying, a woman pulled up next to me to complain to the cashier that something was wrong with her order. Î¾So she jumped in front of me to get her order fixed. Î¾Neutral about this since I don't have details.Take home: I will try them one more time. Î¾If they fail again, I will just pass."
679455688,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,"The ice cream machine is always ""down"" after 11 p.m. If you want a hot fudge sundae, don't even bother."
679455689,2/21/2015 0:29,Atlanta,,,Regular McDonald's. Close to the highway which can be good and bad.
679455690,2/21/2015 1:48,Atlanta,,,"Stopped here on the way downtown this morning to get a yogurt parfait. Î¾These snakes gave me dairy products that had an expired ""use by"" sticker and I didn't even notice until I was halfway to downtown. Gross, guys. Î¾There's no point in putting freshness dates on your food if the employees can't or won't read."
679455691,2/21/2015 1:03,Atlanta,,,"I highly recommend this McDonalds!******if and only if you are trapped at Northside Hospital, are ravenously hungry, and have absolutely no other option. Î¾Eating at this McDonalds is slightly better than eating out of a vending machine or dumpster."
679455692,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,"TOXIC DUMP! In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others ""trapped"" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself ""trapped"" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). Î¾God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It's been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ Î¾YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls! How many more years will you ignore not only the unhealthy food options McDonalds supplies~ but to continue to ALLOW a daily dose of DELIBERATE and DILIGENT unhealthy, negative, and ""put upon"" attitudes from employees, to be delivered to family, friends and employees that are there only because they CARE and are there for YOUR patients! HOW this does NOT cause you to react and ACT is beyond me.In my world, with SO MANY options available, this place would be GONE ~ like TODAY; certainly NOT any longer than tomorrow!This toxic waste site is dumping daily doses of negativity, inhumanity~ its seeping and reverberating within the walls of this hospital. I know you FEEL IT!"
679455693,2/21/2015 1:02,Atlanta,,,"I know i shouldn't need to ask but experience has proven it's a good I idea, tonight I forgot Î¾to ask them to make sure the coffee wasn't old and after i drove any i checked and it was not only old it was cold!"

This branch for neither. Food was really slow to come out and I had to ask thrice for the coffee that i ordered. Shocking service delivery"
679455695,2/21/2015 0:36,Atlanta,,,Little bit more expensive than other Mickey Dee's. Beggars can't be choosy. Slow service and it's packed. its open 24/7/365. and the workers are pretty nice. didn't have many other choices and this filled the need.
679455696,2/21/2015 0:20,Atlanta,,,"This is the McDonald's inside the Northside Hospital.For being the only option to get something to eat (evidently they don't have a proper cafeteria like most hospitals do) it had to do...Complete disorganization are the only two decent words I can come up for this place. Î¾There was a huge rush of people oddly enough that evening, and the staff had no clue what to do. Î¾Orders were wrong, missing items, and the wait time was unbearable."
679455697,2/21/2015 0:18,Atlanta,,,The worst McDonalds ever. Complete chaos. The prices are higher than the average and they don't have all of the regular items like lattes or fraps. The staff seems to be uninterested in taking or completing your order. It is as if they are aware that you are pretty much at their mercy.

679455699,2/21/2015 0:13,Atlanta,,,AND STILL FRENCH FRY CHAMP.........The burger taste not sop much.... But this location fast and friendly.
679455700,2/21/2015 0:28,Atlanta,,,"BEWARE! I saw the manager filling orders for drive-thru customers using bare hands - no gloves or utensils to pack fries - and this is the weirdest thing ever: she was 'fingering' plastic cup lids!?! Don't know what else to call it! She poked her finger through the plastic cup lids (in the slit made for straws) before inserting straws! What the hell for? Imagine a finger, no gloves, super long nails, painted, and this being inserted into every cup lid before inserting the straw! Why did she need to expose customers to her nails and the shit and germs (nails looked filthy!) underneath? She was using her nails as a tool! The straw can be used to go through the straw slit! No need for a finger nail! FILTHY! I saw this going on inside while the poor folks in drive-thru didn't see this! And the cashier had a bad cold and was wiping his runny nose all over with the back of his hand! What can you expect if the manager herself is filthy and polluting the food! Who knows where her hand'a been?"
679455701,2/21/2015 0:21,Atlanta,,,"Worst Mc Donalds in all of Atlanta... 15-25 min stop every time even if they have no customers. Straight ridiculous. I live across the street and REFUSE to stop there. Nope I will NEVER give anyone my money who to a location doesn't value and appreciate it. Same manager every time... common trend? called regional, pretended to care. Either way... only thing they will give you is COLD food after a 30 min wait, a major headache and crappy service! SKIP THIS STOP!"

Î¾Is everybody going to Mickey Dees today?You can guess that volumes of business like this, means that someone's going to get their order wrong...and today it was me.They put cheese on my steak BISCUIT, but I requested a steak and egg BAGEL.

Î¾This location was recently LEVELED and rebuilt - and they did a complete 180 - and when I say that, the building was even rotated by 90 degrees.So this is in an area where most of the streets around it are one way, so it can be confusing to get in and out of - and the previous drive-thru began and ended in different places. Î¾Now, they redesigned the place so that it makes more sense and the flow works even better than before - and the previous location was there for 30 years? Î¾Wow.The new one is sleek, clean, modern and beautiful. Î¾The drive-thru staff was super friendly (I was buying a Sprite for heaven's sake) and both the young lady who took my money and the one who handed me my drink said ""we hope to see you back here again soon."" Î¾That's great service, personable and I would be happy to return (not that I do McD's very often). Î¾But I'm more apt to come to this one than any other."

Since McDonald's is the only place with a drive-thru on my way to work I stopped by here to grab their special 2 bacon, egg, & cheese biscuits for $2.50. The food was ok, just tasted like you would expect McDonald's food to taste. The service was pretty good at the drive-thru, they were friendly enough.

Î¾It was around 1:45 pm on a Saturday afternoon, and there were probably only two cars in front of me, so I thought I'd be in and out of there quickly. Î¾What I thought would be a ""quick"" drive-thru took over ten minutes. Î¾I'm not sure what the hold up was, but perhaps one (or both) of the cars in front of me got a large order. Î¾All I ordered was a Spicy McChicken Sandwich, small fries, and a cup of ice water.Again, Curry Honda is located super close to the McDonald's, so the food should have still been hot (or at least warm) when I got there. Î¾However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted. Î¾I guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers. Î¾Boo. Î¾It was my first time trying the Spicy McChicken Sandwich, and I thought it was decent. Î¾It has a very slight kick of spice and is at least a little more interesting than the plain ol' McChicken Sandwich.Overall, this McDonald's gets 3 stars for being ""OK."" Î¾Yes, service could have been quicker, and the food should have been served hotter, but this is a McDonald's and at least the employees were friendly. Î¾I may return to this McDonald's if I'm on my way to Curry Honda and didn't have time to grab food elsewhere, but it wouldn't be my top choice for fast food in the area.[Review 324 of 366]"

I told him what happened and that I'd like the specialty coffee I originally ordered. He pointed that it had been a week since the original purchase and that he needed proof I wasn't lying about my incorrect order. Mind you, at 6:30am 6 people were all waiting around for their order, which shows slow and poor service. I didn't argue and I walked away leaving my receipt on the counter. I was simply asking for a coffee, not even an entire meal. I don't post about these sort of things, but this time was different. The manager could have easily offered a variety of resolutions, but all he said was ""no I'm sorry"".

I never make it a goal to be difficult to other people and I find it very rude, let alone unnecessary, that I received this treatment. It is part of your job's duties to simply put in a customer's order. If you don't like your job, you have no business being there, and there are plenty of job seekers out there who would be more deserving of your position.

Î¾ Î¾I do not know anything about the dining area since I always use the drive thru. Customer service has been great as they always take care of me.When I go to McDonalds I get either the Big Mac meal or the quarter pounder meal.

I have been down the road at least three times now only to find that they've given me the wrong biscuit - even when the correct one is on my receipt.

679455743,2/21/2015 2:30,Atlanta,,,"The service at this McDonald's is so bad it's almost comical. Case in point: There was about a two week stretch where I would go to McDonald's every morning before work to get an iced vanilla latte. EVERY day (I kid you not) they got my order wrong and made me a hot latte instead. This would not be a problem, but they questioned me every time if I was sure that was what I ordered. Yes, it even showed it on your fancy digital menu. Then they would ask me to pull up and wait 10 minutes for my order to be corrected. My bf and I went inside once to order and they got his order wrong. The woman just stood there and looked at us when we told her and my bf was like, ""...but I guess I can eat this"". Later when we went up and asked for sauce, she gave us the biggest eyeroll upon seeing us and acted like it was physically painful for her to serve us. These are only a couple of examples of the horrible service we have had, but I guess that's typical for a McDonald's attached to a gas station."

Î¾I said ""what holiday"" she says Columbus day. I never had respect for that man but do recognize his holiday is on the 13th for my bank so I informed Starla that yesterday was not a bank holiday.

Ask for no ketchup on my sandwich? Make that extra ketchup, no mustard. Light ice? Load the cup to the top!Getting my order wrong 50% of the time aside, the service is also frequently unfriendly or distracted and almost always painfully slow.I'd rather skip it and go somewhere that can get my order right and do it with a smile."
679455760,2/21/2015 0:25,Atlanta,,,Well I guess the saying is true....you get what you pay for. They forgot to put cheese on my breakfast sandwich....though its frustrating....this IS mcdonalds...no one should ever expect more out of them. At least my caramel mocha was good.

Î¾It's super convenient to stop by and grab a quick bite before watching a movie if you don't want to spend a lot of money for food at the theater. Î¾But that's pretty much where the pros of this location stop.I've been to this McDonald's several times, but I've been a bit disappointed on several occasions. Î¾Most recently, I went through the drive-thru and got a simple order - a McChicken sandwich and small fries. Î¾I drove to the Studio Movie Grill parking lot to eat before a movie and noticed that my fries were cold. Î¾UGHHHHH... Î¾Cold McDonald's fries are the worst. Î¾Lame!!!The employees seem to be pretty friendly, and the restaurant looks decent inside. Unfortunately, they lack power outlets (I saw one, but maybe there's a one or two more scattered throughout the restaurant). Î¾This makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald's to use their laptops, which I do quite often.Overall, this McDonald's deserves about 2.5 stars because it's right in between ""meh"" and ""A-OK."" Î¾I know some may say it's ""just a McDonald's,"" but hey - I've been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent (don't serve COLD fries!) and there are numerous power outlets for customers' use. Î¾I'll probably be back just because it's right next to Studio Movie Grill, but I'm hoping they'll start improving the quality of their fast food - at least to the McDonald's standard.[Review 076 of 366]"

(oh, when a place has ""NOW HIRING ALL SHIFTS"" signs up for ever...be warned.... there is one elderly latina lady at the drive thru whose 'here you go hun' and smile could melt and iceberg- what a joy! but...once had horrible service- complained and got an out of date coupon for one small sandwich, fries, and drink. really?"

I work late nights and when I do get off work if there nothing ready in the house I will stop and my only option is McDonalds or Checkers. Needless to say this is nothing short of ""ghetto"". I could hear the employees in the background laughing and playing over the intercom as I'm ordering the food. After I ordered, she didn't even bother to tell me my total or go over my order with me. Î¾When I made it to the window she was having a conversation with her co worker despite me having my hand out the window to give her the money. When I drove up to the second window....someone had been smoking a cigarette and threw it right outside the drive-through window. Now I don't know if it was maybe a previous customer or and employee but nobody was in front of me when I pulled up but hard to say. I could hear the music they were playing over my radio in the car and to top it off. Somebody was calling another chick a ""B*tch"" and just being loud. I mean hey, didn't expect nothing spectacular but if these are the people thats making my Big Mac, I'll pass. The day shift is the complete opposite so don't be discouraged too much by this. My food tasted McDonalds worthy but they need to change up that scenery a bit."

I really don't know what their problem is. It's bad every single time I've been there, despite the hour, despite the number of cars in line...There are two reasons why I continue to return to this McD's. The first is it's convenient location. The second: my food is always hot and prepared correctly. Despite the ridiculously slow line, I've never received cold fries or a wrong order. I'm not sure what they're doing back there to make things run so agonizingly slowly, but my food always comes out fine."

Then travel back through the parking lot to your get your Mc-Grub without inconveniencing all the people in cars trying to get to work or home.This advice makes much more sense than the numbskulls trying to cut through solid traffic just to get some fast food. And for you people who chose to live in ""hidden cove"" next to, and east of, McDonalds... you have no luck in being able to pull out easily. The traffic is always solid in front of that entrance/exit and you really should have chosen another place to live with easy egress. I know a clue is a lot to ask for these days."

One day me and hubby were in a rush in the morning and grabbed "" breakfast "" when we got Into the car we look inside of our bag and we have all lunch items. We go back inside to correct our order and we are informed that breakfast is over and there is nothing they can do.

The ONLY reason I ever eat at a Mickey D's is because it's a) fast, b) cheap and c) predictable. You know the food won't be awesome, but it will be reasonably eatable. Man, was I disappointed on points b) and c).First, the medium Quarter Pounder meal was more than six bucks. Jeez, that's hardly a deal.What made the sticker shock worse was the poor quality of the food. This had to be the worst Quarter Pounder I've ever (half) eaten. Maybe even the worst fast food burger I've ever had. It looked like it had been sitting out on Uncle Zeke's radiator all morning. The burger patties were gray and curled up at the edges. The bun was dry and crusty. It's like the damn thing was somehow mummified. Just nasty. Too bad I didn't have time to take it back.This will probably be the very last time I ever eat at a McDonald's. It was that bad."
679455792,2/21/2015 0:38,Las Vegas,,,"The worst service ever. And I'm not a rude person, at all. I said ""please"" and ""thank you."" And I absolutely was not greeted whatsoever. Whoever that dumbass lady was, that was working needs to take that stick out of her. Don't be mad at me 'cause you hate YOUR job, bitch. Let's not forget that everyone is REPLACEABLE, including your miserable self. It took every bit of me not to cuss her out. I'd write a letter to corporate but she did not give me a receipt. Go figure right. I'm not one to talk down on people that works fast food because it's not in my character to knock someone's hustle. But she really needs to get it together. And for that, I will NOT ever return to this McDonald's ever again. Some bullshit. Oh. And. Not only did I not get a receipt... I didn't get a straw. And instead of 10 piece chicken nuggets, I got 9.

We finally pulled up to the window & the car in front of us entire order was wrong. They had to pull up front & wait. When we made it to the window he asked us ""did you order?"" & we confirmed yes ""he asked what it was"". Once we told him what our order was he said ""for real "". I was floored at the TERRIBLE service of this chain. The service was so bad I took a photo of the phone number posted outside the window to file a complaint. After he confirmed our order (which was only two drinks) we waited at that window another 5 minutes to get the drinks. When we drove off we noticed it was a slu of cars waiting behind us.The guy working the window CLEARLY did not know what he was doing & shouldn't have been working the drive thru.

Î¾Here is the entire conversation: Me: Î¾Can I get some Mayonnaise and Salt? MD's: Î¾Mayonnaise? Î¾(as he is chatting with a co-worker and not listening to me.Me: Yes, Mayonnaise and Salt.MD's: OK. Î¾(Still chatting it up with co-worker)MD's: Î¾That was Mayonnaise and Jelly?Me: No. Î¾Mayonnaise and Salt.UGH!! Î¾Pay attention! Î¾Needless to say, I got to work and order was incomplete. Î¾Frustrated, I got back in my car, drove back to restaurant and went inside. Î¾Talked to a manager or assistant (couldn't tell, as they had no nametag), but they were very uninterested in the fact that a customer had an issue. Î¾I explained that it had happened 4 times in last month, still no reaction. Î¾No concern, NO APOLOGY. Î¾ Î¾He proceeded to get my other item, but was not going to replace the current one I brought back. Î¾Since it was now a cold item, I had to ask to get a replacement.I mentioned again that this is the 4th time in a month that this had happened to just me, but again, no apology, no concern, and no reaction. Î¾Worst customer service of any restaurant I've ever been in. Î¾It seems to me that they need to be reading these reviews and try to improve. Î¾I will be sending a copy of this review to McDonald's corporate office, because if they are not already aware of how bad this store is, they need to be."

The wait for food here is unreal. this last week my mcdouble tasted more like it was reheated. The bun was rock hard :(I just never know if I'm going to get what I ordered correctly or if it will taste normal or reheated. I have been getting coupon books in the mail that have been good deals. Inside feels kinda cramped. The lines inside are as bad as the drive thru. Please remember that people leaving the drive thru have rights too. I obey the stop sign before pulling out but it seems the people shopping within the strip mall think they have the right to zip by you and not let you out.
679455822,2/21/2015 1:05,Las Vegas,,,"I'm so relieved I'm not the only one who knows how dysfunctional this McDonalds is compared to any other. Î¾Every time I'd be in the drive-thru they'd get my order wrong, and as I waited for my upcoming wrong order with cars in front of me, I entertained myself by (1) watching Î¾the hand-off of food from the employee Î¾to the driver of the car; (2) a slight pause; and (3) Î¾then the hand back as the driver QA's and returns the wrong order that was given to them. Î¾I hope this McDonald's improves because I'm sure there are some good employees who work here and this is such a great location for this restaurant."
679455823,2/21/2015 0:21,Las Vegas,,,Don't come in. Their priority is the drive thru. Don't waste your time. Horrible customer service. I will be avoiding this place as much as possible.
679455824,2/21/2015 0:31,Las Vegas,,,The drive- thru might be the worst. Î¾I've gone through a few times. Î¾The staff is rude and when they short your order your made to feel like it's your fault .
679455825,2/21/2015 0:09,Las Vegas,,,I dont mind fresh and hot...but when you have to wait 15 minutes to order and another 15 minutes to receive the order plus bad attitude....not a good mixTry two cashiers when you got 4 people or more in one line...that would cut the first 15 minutes
679455826,2/21/2015 0:42,Las Vegas,,,"Flavorless cardboard and meat like substance.., Î¾ Unfit for human consumption !!! Î¾ Î¾ Î¾I gave irvine last try and it's worse than ever"
679455827,2/21/2015 0:43,Las Vegas,,,"This is the only burger place within 5 minutes of my office so I've been going here to pick up my lunch before starting work. However, this morning I get there at 10:25 because i have to be at work at 10:35. I try to order a chicken wrap and I'm told they can't take lunch orders until 10:30. Now up until recently I worked in the food industry for 14 years as a manager and I understand the reason for these time frames for breakfast and lunch, but at 5 minutes till I can get a wrap so I can make it to my office with lunch on time? I asked the order taker if they could please help me out it was only 5 minutes and they flat out refused. OUTSTANDING CUSTOMER SERVICE GUYS!! Won't be going back. There is a Vons, a Port of Subs, a Panda Express, an Ensteins Bagels, 2 Pizza Places, and a couple of other restraunts all in the same shopping center so just keep pushing business away to your competitors.Monday June 9, 2014 10:45 am"
679455828,2/21/2015 0:54,Las Vegas,,,This is hands down the WORST McD's location.I keep saying I wont go back but I think what keeps me going back is that living in the heart of Summerlin there isn't much of an option besides the Burger King on Town Center.The drive-thru is always so so so long and the workers at the window are so slow and seem like it is their first day every time. My order is NEVER right! I order a McGriddle and get a McMuffin WTH! The food is either overcooked or not accurate. What is with the coke? It always and I mean always tastes weird.I have sent an e-mail through the website complaining and they said since nobody else complained about the coke it must be fine. WRONG! If you get the nasty coke please send them an e-mail if enough people complain they might actually do something!!I usually go to the location on Charleston but since this one is so close I do still come here when I have coupons but I make sure and go inside where I can verify my order.
679455829,2/21/2015 0:31,Las Vegas,,,"I don't know what it is about this McDonald's. It's like kids run the joint. Not that they aren't friendly, but too many of them just aren't professional, and seem to think the customers are part of their entertainment. This job is basically an extension to their social life. Î¾It's a problem."
679455830,2/21/2015 0:32,Las Vegas,,,Service is terribly slow. Orders have never been correct. Manager Oscar is trained in a third world country. I have boycotted this location for the last year and I live and work within walking distance of this place. I'd much rather go out of my way and give my money to the Boca Park location.
679455831,2/21/2015 0:37,Las Vegas,,,This was the worst Mcdonalds in all of Las Vegas. Î¾My daughter wanted a breakfast burrito and I needed a coffee. 1 car in front in of me and 23 minutes stuck in the drive thru. WHO's the manager? I didnt see one person that was capable of being in charge of running that place. Next tiem I decide to go to Mcdonalds by my job I will hop on the freeway and go to another one and still return to work faster then running across the street to this one!!!!!!
679455832,2/21/2015 0:21,Las Vegas,,,"Honestly McDonalds is a McDonalds but I've never been to one so slow. Went in to grab some breakfast and, although no one was there, it still took 20 min. The fact that I keep coming back is just because it is close."
